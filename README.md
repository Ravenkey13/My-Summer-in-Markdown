## Topic 1
Introduction: Hi my name is Alejandro Garcia and I am a sophmore in the magnet program at chatsworth. Something about me is that I am in band for the school and I am taking 3 ap classes and might end up taking a 4th one but only self studying. I come from a Mexican family grew up loving soccer through my brother. I am very happy with how I am and what makes me who I am because I always here people say good stuff about me and what I do which makes me proud of what and who I have become.
## Topic 2
Summer Activities: Something I did over the summer was that I went hiking around a hiking trial in chatsworth and I went to a workshop to make merchandise for my position in a club. Something else I did was did summer school and managed to learn and play volleyball. Towards the end of my summer I went to the beach and whatched the sandlot light at night in long beach and it was really fun and enjoyable.

Personal Achievements: The band one first place in district championships and I was part of it. I passed my first ap exam. I built a telescope when I was in second grade and it wasn't those little kid telescopes and I'm proud of it. No one else in my family knew how to do it and I did it in less than an hour.
## Topic 4
Favorite Summer Food: During the summer I had soup over the summer and it's just perfect for any time of the year. Soup is pretty much my comfort food and theres really no time of the year where you can't have it and not enjoy it. It is the best type of food in my opinion because for me it comforts me and bring me peace for a good 30 minutes.
## Topic 5
Most Memorable Experience: My most memorable moment was getting my first dog. I remember it was like 2 years ago when we got a dog and since then he's been with us. We named him Paco short for Paco Memo Ochoa after the famous goalie for Mexico. Since we are huge soccer fans and massive Mexico fans it seemed right to name our dog after a hero for us and for pretty much most if not all Mexicans.
